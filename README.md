## Unit testing nodes for Erlang-RED

Nodes for testing flow correctness in the [Erlang-RED](https://github.com/gorenje/erlang-red) project.

These could be thought of the first Erlang-RED-first nodes! They provided limited functionality within Node-RED as they deal with testing of node functionality and nodes are assumed to work in Node-RED.

## Artifacts

- [NPMjs Package]()
- [Node-RED node package]()
- [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/gorenje/erlang-red-unittesting-nodes)
